# 🩺 AI-Powered Health Risk Prediction System (Real-Time GCP Pipeline)

## 📖 Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Health Risk Prediction System** is a real-time healthcare analytics pipeline built entirely on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
It continuously streams simulated patient health data, performs **real-time monitoring, alerting, transformation, and machine learning-based prediction**, and delivers insights through **Looker dashboards**.

This project demonstrates how an enterprise can build **low-latency, scalable, and intelligent healthcare monitoring systems** using GCP’s fully managed services.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Stream live health telemetry data for patients.  
- Detect anomalies and generate **automated alerts** when risk levels exceed thresholds.  
- Maintain a **modern data-lakehouse architecture** with Bronze → Silver → Gold layers.  
- Train **ML models in BigQuery ML** to predict patient risk trends.  
- Deliver real-time reports and insights via **Looker dashboards**.

### 🧩 Design Evolution & Learnings

While building this system, I learned that **real-time and batch orchestration require different execution models** on GCP.  
Initially, I wanted to run everything — ingestion, transformation, validation, and alerts — in a single unified pipeline.  
But during testing, I discovered that this approach was not scalable or maintainable in a real-time production setup.

---

#### ⚠️ Challenge 1: One Job Can’t Handle It All
At first, I tried using a **single Dataflow pipeline** to perform:
- Ingestion from Pub/Sub  
- Validation and transformation  
- Threshold-based alerting  

However, combining all of these caused operational issues.  
The job became complex, error-prone, and **not compatible with continuous production streaming** because each operation had its own frequency and latency needs.

---

#### ⚙️ Challenge 2: Latency & Bottlenecks
When all processes were handled in one Dataflow job, it created:
- **High data lag** and inconsistent watermarking  
- **System bottlenecks**, as transformations waited on alert logic  
- **Scalability issues**, since streaming jobs need to run continuously while transformations are periodic  

From this, I learned the key architectural principle:  
> “In real-time pipelines, alerting and transformations should be handled by separate, specialized jobs.”

---

#### 🏗️ Solution: Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
To address these challenges, I implemented a **Medallion Data Architecture** for BigQuery:
- 🥉 **Bronze (Raw):** Native data streamed from Pub/Sub into BigQuery using **Dataflow Job 1**  
- 🥈 **Silver:** Cleaned, validated, and deduplicated data using **scheduled SQL queries** in **Cloud Composer**  
- 🥇 **Gold:** Fully curated, analytics-ready data optimized for **ML training** and **Looker dashboards**

This separation provided **data lineage, maintainability, and reliability**, allowing each process to run independently.

---

#### ⚡ Challenge 3: Orchestration Compatibility
Initially, I thought to orchestrate all pipelines (Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery) within **Cloud Composer**.  
But I soon realized that:
- **Pub/Sub** and **Dataflow** are **streaming and continuously running** services  
- **Cloud Composer (Airflow)** is designed for **scheduled, event-based orchestration**  

This means **continuous pipelines** don’t fit into Composer’s DAG execution cycle.

So instead:
- I used **Flex Templates** to deploy Dataflow jobs that run continuously outside of Composer.  
- Composer now focuses on **batch orchestration** — scheduling SQL scripts, updating the Silver and Gold tables, and triggering **ML training and prediction workflows**.

---

#### 🧠 Final Insight: Balancing Real-Time and Batch
The final system balances **real-time streaming** and **scheduled batch orchestration**:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Streaming Layer** | Pub/Sub → Dataflow | Real-time ingestion & alert pipeline |
| **Storage Layer** | BigQuery (Bronze) | Central raw data lake |
| **Transformation Layer** | Cloud Composer (SQL DAGs) | Cleansing, validation & enrichment |
| **ML Layer** | BigQuery ML | Model training & predictions |
| **Alert Layer** | Pub/Sub → Cloud Function → SendGrid | Real-time alerts via email |
| **Visualization Layer** | Looker | Dashboard insights via materialized views |

By decoupling these layers, the system now supports **low-latency alerts**, **high-quality analytics**, and **scalable model retraining**, achieving a truly **real-time AI-powered health monitoring system**.

## 🧠 Architecture Story (Step-by-Step Flow)

### 1. Data Simulation & Ingestion
A Python script continuously generates **synthetic patient data** (Age, HeartRate, BloodPressure, Temperature, etc.).  
This data is published to a **Pub/Sub topic**, acting as the ingestion gateway for the system.

### 2. Parallel Dataflow Pipelines
Two **Dataflow jobs** (Apache Beam pipelines) process the streaming data:
- **Dataflow Job 1:** Reads JSON messages from Pub/Sub and writes them into **BigQuery (Bronze layer)**.
- **Dataflow Job 2:** Reads the same stream, applies **threshold logic** on the `RiskScore` field, and if it exceeds a defined limit, pushes it to another **Pub/Sub alert topic**.

### 3. Real-Time Alerting
The alert topic triggers a **Cloud Function**, which sends an automated email via **SendGrid API** whenever a high-risk patient is detected.  
Alerts reach the configured Gmail inbox within seconds — enabling proactive intervention.

### 4. Data Transformation Layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
Data is stored and refined in **BigQuery** across three layers:
- 🥉 **Bronze (Raw):** All ingested JSON records.  
- 🥈 **Silver:** Cleaned and validated data via scheduled SQL queries in **Cloud Composer**.  
- 🥇 **Gold:** Fully curated data, optimized for ML and analytics.

### 5. Machine Learning in BigQuery ML
Using the **Gold** table, the system trains a **classification/regression model** (e.g., XGBoost or Logistic Regression) to predict patient risk scores for upcoming days or weeks.  
Predictions and accuracy metrics are stored back into BigQuery for continuous evaluation.

### 6. Insights & Visualization
**Materialized Views** built on top of the Gold and prediction tables provide near real-time insights for dashboards.  
These are connected to **Looker Studio**, giving stakeholders a clear view of patient trends, risk levels, and forecasted outcomes.
